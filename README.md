# Assessing Validity of UFO Sightings
## 1. Overview
We analyzed a UFO sighting dataset obtained from Kaggle.

https://www.kaggle.com/NUFORC/ufo-sightings

This dataset contains over 80,000 reports of UFO sightings from 1906 to the middle of 2014. This data was collected by the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC). Most of these sightings occured in the United States, but there are some reportings in the UK, Canada, Australia, and Germany. As we discussed in our slides, we were able to find some common causes of false reportings and find a particular event that seemed the most likely to be valid.

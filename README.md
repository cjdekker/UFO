# Verifying UFO Sightings
## 1. Overview
We analyzed UFO sighting dataset which is obtained from Kaggle website.

https://www.kaggle.com/NUFORC/ufo-sightings

This dataset contains over 80,000 reports of UFO sightings from 1906 to the middle of 2014 and it was collected by National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC). Most of sightings are in United States. Others occured in UK, Canada, Australia or Germany. As we described in our slides, after analysing, it turns out that some "UFO sightings" can be thought as misunderstanding of something other than UFO.
